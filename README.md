## 📖 Overview

This project serves as a learning companion to the main Electrostatics website.  
It features a mini quiz styled after the popular Wordle game but is designed for classroom implementation.  
Students have three tries to guess a word related to physics concepts, and results are shown at the end of the session.

The quiz restricts tab switching and refresh behavior to prevent cheating and ensures results are authentic and final.
