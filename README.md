## 📖 Overview

This quiz is a standalone companion site built to enhance the Electrostatics lessons. It adopts Wordle-inspired mechanics to test students' understanding of key terms in a fun and meaningful way. Players are given three tries to guess a keyword, but only the final guess is graded.

A one-attempt-only system is implemented, backed by an anti-cheat detection feature that flags refreshes and tab switching to uphold answer integrity.
