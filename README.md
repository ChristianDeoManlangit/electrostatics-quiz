## 📖 Overview

This website serves as a gamified quiz platform for students studying **Electrostatics**.  
It simulates a **Wordle-style guessing game**—but instead of random words, users are challenged to answer physics-related questions. Each game session gives the player **3 chances** to guess the answer using a letter-based grid system.

It’s tightly integrated with the main Electrostatics website and helps reinforce concepts through interactive recall.
